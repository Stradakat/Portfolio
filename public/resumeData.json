Rick was detail oriented in following the designs submitted, and when the designs didn't work out, figured out creative ways to achieve the same results. He is always eager to find tools to help the development process, and to learn new skills along the way. Because the project he worked on was for a visualization tool and he was the chief front-end developer, his efforts went a long way towards the success of the team.",
